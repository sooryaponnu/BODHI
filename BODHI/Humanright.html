                  In India, for a long time, disabled individuals were considered a liability and were subjected to stigmatization and discrimination. However, around the 1980s, it was felt that disabled people must be provided with an opportunity to participate in societal development. Governments, NGOs, and society at large realized that disability was a medical condition which could be addressed through appropriate rehabilitation. With the UN declaring the 1982-1992 period as the Decade of Disabled Persons, the rehabilitation movement got a further boost. The Decade of Disabled Persons played a key role in improving the status of  disabled people. Emphasis was laid on improving educational and employment status and raising more funds for the disabled.

The Indian Government set up the Rehabilitation Council of India in 1986 with the aim of facilitating the rehabilitation of disabled people. Furthermore, the National Policy on Disability was adopted in 2009. This comprehensive policy focuses on critical areas such as education, employment, social security, etc., for the disabled

                <br>
                <h4>Need for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016</h4>
                <br>

                The primary aim of enacting the Act was to safeguard the interests of people who suffer from disabilities. This Act provided for the individuality and dignity of disabled people, prevented discrimination against them, and called for an inclusive society. 

The Act was enacted owing to India’s international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This Convention was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December, 2006. India ratified the Convention in 2007. As per the Convention, the signatory States were mandated to enact new laws or amend the existing laws to remove obstacles to the development and growth of disabled people. The National Policy on Disabled Persons needed to be modified in order to bring it in line with the 2007 UN Convention. 

The Convention imposed a duty on the States, private individuals, and civil society to ensure that the rights of disabled people were secured. The signatory States are under an obligation to not only ensure the implementation of the Convention but also to modify their domestic law to bring it on par with the provisions of the Constitution and to prepare the country’s report.

India, being one of the first signatories of the Convention, enacted the 2016 Act to fulfill its obligations under the Convention. In November, 2015, India submitted its first country’s report. 

This Act, furthermore, widened the definition of disability by incorporating 21 types of disabilities, as compared to 7 in the preceding statute. The schedule to the Act covers physical disability, mental disability, intellectual disability, and disability resulting from chronic neurological conditions and blood disorders. Acid attack victims and those with speech and language disabilities have been included in the list for the first time.
<br> 
<br>

    <h4>Overview of Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
      The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 aims to provide certain rights to disabled people and protect them from social stigmatization and discrimination. Section 2(s) of the Act defines “person with disability” as a person who suffers from long-term mental, physical, sensory or intellectual impairment which, in collaboration with barriers, affects his effective participation in society.

The definition of disability provided in the 2016 Act is much more inclusive than the definition in the preceding Act. The 1995 Act included only those persons within the definition of disabled persons who suffered from a 40% or more of a certified disability. 

Section 27 of the Act also provides for the rehabilitation of a disabled person. The appropriate government is responsible for the rehabilitation of the disabled, with a special focus on education, employment, and health concerns. The appropriate government has to provide financial assistance to those non-government organizations which are engaged in facilitating the rehabilitation of disabled people. s

    <h4>Objectives of Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016</h4>
    <br>

    <p>
      <ul><li>The primary objective of the Act is to ensure that disabled people enjoy their right to equality and are able to live a dignified and respectful life. </li></ul>
<ul><li>The Preamble of the Act provides that it is aimed at protecting disabled people from all sorts of discrimination. The Act seeks to ensure the full social, political, and economic participation of disabled people. </li></ul>
<ul><li>This Act promotes inclusive education and provides employment safeguards for disabled people. Thus, it aims at empowering disabled people through inclusive growth and active societal participation.</li></ul></p>
<br>

<h4>Rights of disabled persons</h4>
<br>

Chapter II of the Act deals with the rights of disabled people. Disabled people have been conferred with the following rights:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>They have a right to equality and protection from discrimination. They cannot be discriminated against due to their disability. The appropriate government is responsible for ensuring that the dignity and integrity of the disabled persons is not violated. 
The disabled persons have a right to live in the community and the government is responsible for protecting them from being forced into living in any specific arrangement. </li><br>
<li>The disabled persons enjoy equal rights and cannot be forced into undergoing infertility medical procedures. 
The Central as well as the state elections commissioners are responsible for ensuring that the polling booths are accessible to disabled people.</li> <br>
<li>The disabled persons are to be protected from violence and exploitation. They cannot be subjected to any degrading or cruel treatment. Disabled people cannot be forced to be the subject of research without their consent. In case of any natural disaster or emergency, they have equal rights to safety and protection. Section 7(2) of the Act provides that if any registered organization believes that an act of violence or abuse is likely to be committed against a disabled person, then the registered organization must give such information to the Executive Magistrate having the requisite jurisdiction.</li> <br>
<li>Section 38 of the Act provides that where a person suffering from benchmark disability believes that he is in need of high support, he can make an application for such high support to the notified authority. An application in this regard can also be made by any other person or organization on behalf of the disabled person. Such an application is to be forwarded to the Assessment Board, which will assess the application and submit a report to the concerned authority. The disabled person would then be provided high support on the basis of the report and the relevant government schemes.</li><br>
<li>The Act also provides that if an employee acquires a disability while he is in service, he may not be dismissed or removed from employment. He may be transferred to another suitable post but the pay scale cannot be reduced.</li><br></ul>

<p>Chapter III of the Act deals with the education of disabled children. Section 16 of the Act imposes a duty on government funded educational institutions to provide inclusive education to disabled children. Educational institutions are prevented from discriminating against children suffering from disabilities and are required to provide education, sports and recreation facilities to the disabled children, provide them with reasonable accommodation, make the campus more accessible to them, ensure that dead and blind children are imparted education using appropriate means of communication and suitable pedagogic means, provide them with transport facilities and monitor their participation and progress. 

Section 17 aims at promoting inclusive education. It provides that the government and the local authorities are responsible for setting up training institutes and for training staff and professions on how to promote inclusive education. Children with a benchmark disability are entitled to free books and other learning materials until they attain the age of 18 years. 

Section 32 provides for a 5% reservation in all government higher education institutes and those educational institutes that are beneficiaries of government funds.</p>
