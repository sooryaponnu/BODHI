                        <p>Stephen Hawking was born on 8 Jan 1942, which was the 300th death anniversary of Galileo. Though he was born to a well-educated parents, the time he was born was quite difficult as his parents did not have money back then and also the Second World War was making livelihoods rather challenging, in search of a safer place his family returned to Oxford, Stephen had three siblings and therefore the family had scarcity of money.

His early school life was not outstanding, he was third from the bottom in his class but he enjoyed board games and like geniuses do, he with his friends created their own board games, he also made computers out of waste part to solve mathematical equations not only this, he loved to climb, dance and rowing.

He loved mathematics but as Oxford did not have the degree he had to take up Physics and later went in specifics of it, Cosmology.

Where he believes he was not able to spend time on studies and was paying much attention to school on the other hand he was exploring science.</p>

<p>He was 21 years old when he was diagnosed with ALS, it all started in Oxford when he began to notice that he would trip and fall or slur his speech, till 1963 he ignored it but it was his father who took notice of this condition and took him to the doctor. A series of tests diagnosed that its Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), which is when the nerves that control muscles were failing. He was told that he wouldn’t survive more than two years.When everyone had lost hope then Stephen had a dream that he was going to be executed and he believes this disease helped him to become the scientist he is today, as he says “Before my condition was diagnosed, I had been very bored with life, there had not seemed to be anything worth doing.” With the sudden realisation that he might not even live long enough to earn his PhD, Hawking dedicated all his energies to his work and research. In one of his interviews he also mentioned – “My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus.”</p>

<p>It all began with his research on Black holes, to his first major publication The Grand Design -Hawking set out to challenge Sir Isaac Newton’s belief that the universe had to have been designed by God, simply because it could not have been born from chaos. “It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going” and till today he is in headlines for his new theories and work.He did not recover from his disease and it made him physically weak in time, but what kept him going was his willingness to work from the mind as he says “Although I cannot move and I have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free.”</p>
<p>He didn’t close his mind when his body failed and today at the age of 73 while he was just given hardly anytime he proved that it’s about the will to live and readiness to accept challenges. Death has to come but the life which we have between birth and death is up to us and it’s our will how we want to live. As he says – “I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die.” (Stephen Hawking)

When a man who can’t move, or talk, can make wonders and also lead a normal family life with kids, then why do some of us lose hope and accept failures? Is it right to flow in the river of sadness when the grave is not the goal?

<p>Hawking has always been portrayed as a brilliant scientist who overcame his disability and made remarkable achievements. But sadly, there was another side to him as well. In the book 'Hawking: the Selling of a Scientific Celebrity,' Charles Seife reveals that side of Hawking.In 1999, Hawking tried to have Andrew Farley, a Ph.D. student, kicked off from Cambridge just because his research jeopardized Hawking's belief of information being destroyed in black holes (the belief which Hawking himself changed later on in his life). But the university paid no heed to Hawking. So, Farley was eventually able to complete his Ph.D. But his confidence took a severe hit. Imagine admiring one of the most famous scientists in the world since childhood, and then, when you meet him, you end up getting bullied by him. It would devastate anyone. After this incident, Hawking also ended his long friendship with Farley's Ph.D. supervisor, Hawking's graduate student, several years earlier. </p>

After Hawking was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, doctors told Hawking that he had only 2 years left on earth. Yet, defying everyone's expectations, he lived for 55 more years. And by doing so, he became a symbol of hope and motivation for people with disabilities.
Hawking believed that technology was imperative for mankind's survival. Yet, he could not bring himself to trust in Artificial Intelligence. In 2014, during the launch of the Centre for the Future of Intelligence at Cambridge University, he said, "Alongside the benefits, AI will also bring dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many."
Hawking was a great fan of space exploration. He firmly believed that humans have to move to planets other than earth. During a conference in Norway in 2017, he said, "We are running out of space, and the only places to go to are other worlds. It is time to explore other solar systems. Spreading out may be the only thing that saves us from ourselves. I am convinced that humans need to leave earth."
Even though his discovery of Hawking's radiation was a remarkable achievement, it could not be observed due to its extremely low energy. So, Stephen Hawking never got a Nobel prize. But he won various other medals throughout his life. One of these is the USA Presidential medal of freedom, which Barack Obama awarded him in 2009.</p>
