                        <p>Elon Musk is one of the world's most polarizing figures. But whether you envy his mind or moderately fear it, there's undeniable curiosity behind how the billionaire's brain works. And the world's richest man recently gave some much-desired insight into the inner workings of his mind.

On April 14, Musk sat down for an hour-long TED Talk interview, which was facilitated by the head of TED Chris Anderson. During the talk, Musk discussed everything from bidding on Twitter to Tesla technology to the meaning of life to, yes, his brain.

The 50-year-old Tesla and SpaceX CEO, who first publicly disclosed that he has Asperger's syndrome in his Saturday Night Live opening monologue in May 2021, further discussed his experience with autism during the TED Talk. Musk shared his personal experience growing up with Asperberg's syndrome, describing how he learned to work with his brain instead of against it.</p>
<div class="albe">
<div class="alb"><img src="https://i.cnnturk.com/i/cnnturk/75/600x0/5a81501cae784915083e5d83.jpg" height="555" width="400"></div>

<p>"Social cues were not intuitive, so I was just very bookish," Musk told Anderson. "Others could intuitively understand what was meant by something. I would take something very literally as if the words that were spoken were exactly what they meant. But that turned out to be wrong. [People are] not simply saying exactly what they mean. There are all sorts of other things that are meant. It took me a while to figure that out. "

Like many autistic children, Musk says he was bullied due to the way his mind worked, not being able to connect with other children in a way familiar to them.

"I did not have such a happy childhood to be frank. It was quite rough," Musk said during the talk. "But I read a lot of books. I read lots and lots of books. Gradually, I understood more [social cues] from the books I was reading."</p>

<p>Though he was bullied for being autistic, Musk suggests his experience with Asperberg's syndrome was ended up aiding his future success. His intense and specialized interest in science and technology was amplified by his hyper-focused mind, a common trait among autistic people.

"I found it rewarding to spend all night programing computers, just by myself," Musk told Anderson. "Most people don't enjoy typing strange symbols into a computer by themselves all night. They think that's not fun. But I really liked it."

But Musk wasn't only fascinated by solving coding problems and tackling scienfic puzzles. Musk also had an obsession with a pretty nebulus concept: truth.

"I was absolutely obsessed with truth. Just obsessed with truth," he said during the talk. "The obsession with truth is why I studied physics because physics attempts to understand the truth of the universe...And then computer science or information theory: There's an argument that information theory is operating at a more fundamental level than even physics."

Though his insights may not explain why Musk tweets the things he does, it does help give more visibility to the autistic experience. And, for once, that's something we can all get behind when it comes to Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Elon Musk became the Richest Man in the World on January 7, 2021, after Tesla's share price surged by 7.9%. It helped him to surpass Jeff Bezos. Musk was featured on the top of the Bloomberg Billionaire Index, a list of the top 500 richest people in the world, on 7th January 2021. Musk had added more than $122 billion to his fortune in the year 2021, which pushed his net worth to $292 billion, according to the reports dated October 2021. This made Elon Musk the first person to be the owner of such a huge fortune. Elon Musk's net worth was then estimated to be $195 billion, which is currently estimated to be over $220 billion. He debuted on the list of the world's richest persons back in 2012, when his net worth was estimated at $2 billion.Musk joined engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning to help operate Tesla Motors in 2004, where he played a key role in the development of the world's first electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster. Musk took over as CEO and product architect after Eberhard was fired from the company in 2007 due to a series of conflicts. </p>

<p>Tesla has grown to be one of the most popular and desirable vehicle brands in the world under his leadership.Elon Musk's SpaceX has signed many high-profile contracts with NASA and the US Air Force to manufacture rockets and execute military missions. Musk has been vocal about his desire to work with NASA on a collaborative mission to deploy an astronaut to Mars by 2025. Elon Musk has always been a proponent of various space-age technologies, but it hasn't always been a smooth journey for him. He went on to become a small business owner and eventually the CEO of two creative firms after being bullied in school. But he made the decision to ascend from there and never settle for anything less.Tesla, in addition to creating electric automobiles, has a strong presence in the solar energy sector, courtesy to its purchase of SolarCity. This clean-energy services company, which was founded in 2006, now develops two rechargeable solar batteries that are primarily used for stationary energy storage. The Powerwall is designed for residential backup power and off-grid use, whereas the Powerpack is designed for business or electric utility grid use.</p>

Elon Musk has never made his desire to make people "multi-planetary animal types". Colonizing Mars would be a decent start as per Musk. In September 2017, at the 68th International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide he unveiled his arrangement to send payload delivers there in the following 5 years. By expansion, he trusts that people will settle the planet when 2024.

Elon's Hyperloop has been contrasted by him with a "cross between a Concorde, a railgun, and an air hockey table". The plan is to eventually give a method for a movement that should have the option to surpass 1124 km/h and all underground.

At present two courses are being developed - between Los Angeles and San Francisco and between New York and Washington D.C. When complete these excursions should take close to 30 minutes utilizing Hyperloop.

At the point when 12 youngsters and their football (soccer) mentor were caught in an overwhelmed collapse in Thailand, Elon and his group developed an apparently insane thought. The arrangement, clearly, was to construct a tyke-estimated submarine. The sub was structured and worked in record time utilizing extra rocket parts. Regardless of this, the salvage groups esteemed it unrealistic and finished the mission without it. "Pedo fellow" aftermath aside Thai military authorities accept the submarine could have utility in the future.</p>
