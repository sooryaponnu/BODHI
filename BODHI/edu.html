               <p>
                  The need for special education in India can be traced back to pre-independent India. There are many examples in Indian history that show that people with disabilities had educational opportunities and that disability did not come in the way of learning. However, during the colonial period, India increasingly looked at educational models existing outside the country. Parents of children with disabilities started schools for their children, mainly from urban areas and with exposure to approaches prevalent in western countries. Since the government had no policy on the education of children with disabilities, it extended grants to these private schools. This approach of setting up separate schools, mostly residential, spread across the country, much of them concentrated in urban areas. For over a century, these special schools offered the only education available to children with disabilities because of the widespread belief that children with special needs could not be educated alongside others. This allowed a small number of children to have access to education but it did not help these children to enter the mainstream community after completing their education

                <h4>INTEGRATED EDUCATION OF THE DISABLED CHILDREN (IEDC, 1974)</h4>
                <br>

                Inclusion, as way of integrating children with special needs into regular
schools, gained prominence in India since 1970. The Centrally sponsored scheme
of Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC) was launched in 1974 by the
then Department of Social Welfare and was later transferred to the Department of
Education in 1982-83. The Scheme was last revised in 1992. The Scheme provides
educational opportunities for children with disabilities in common schools to
facilitate their integration and ultimate retention in the general school system. The
scheme is being implemented through the Education Departments of State
Governments and Union Territories as well as through Non-Governmental
Organizations. Under the Scheme of IEDC, 100 percent assistance is being provided
under various components for education of children suffering from mild to
moderate disabilities in common schools. The components include:
 identification of the children with disabilities.
 preparing and providing teaching and learning materials.
 establishing an administrative cell.
 assessment of children with disability.
 facilities regarding children with special needs.
 appointment of special teachers
 facilitating a resource room.
 provision of instructional material.
 removal of architectural barriers, and
 relaxation of rules to promote access to children with disabilities. The
scheme
IEDC aims at retention in common schools rather than special schools to
develop communication and daily living skills at the functional level [Puri at. al:
2004;19]. The primary task was to provide suitable orientation to all the school
teachers while conducting a survey to identify children with disabilities in general
schools. The responsibility to make arrangements for equipment, learning
materials, staff, etc. in order to provide education to children with disabilities was
given to state-level cell.

        <li> The IEDC scheme has a provision for grant-in-aid for incurring expenditure on books and stationery up to Rs.400/- per annum per child with disabilities. This should be utilized.
